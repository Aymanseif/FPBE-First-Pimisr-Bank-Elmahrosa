| VULN-004         | Missing Security Headers        | Low      | Open     |

### Detailed Findings

#### VULN-001: SQL Injection in Login Form
- **Description:** The login form is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing attackers to manipulate database queries.
- **Impact:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive data.
- **Evidence:** [Insert evidence, e.g., screenshots, logs]
- **Remediation Steps:**
  1. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries.
  2. Validate and sanitize user inputs.

---

#### VULN-002: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Description:** User input is not properly sanitized, allowing for XSS attacks.
- **Impact:** Attackers can execute scripts in the context of the user's browser.
- **Evidence:** [Insert evidence]
- **Remediation Steps:**
  1. Implement input validation and output encoding.
  2. Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks.

---

#### VULN-003: Insecure Direct Object Reference
- **Description:** Users can access resources by manipulating URLs.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
- **Evidence:** [Insert evidence]
- **Remediation Steps:**
  1. Implement access controls to validate user permissions.
  2. Use indirect references for sensitive resources.

---

#### VULN-004: Missing Security Headers
- **Description:** Several security headers are missing from HTTP responses.
- **Impact:** Increased risk of attacks such as clickjacking and XSS.
- **Evidence:** [Insert evidence]
- **Remediation Steps:**
  1. Implement security headers such as X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and Content-Security-Policy.

---

## Recommendations
- Prioritize remediation of high and critical vulnerabilities.
- Conduct regular security training for developers and staff.
- Schedule periodic penetration tests to assess security posture.

---

## Conclusion
The penetration test revealed several vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Immediate action is recommended to remediate the identified issues and enhance the overall security posture of the organization.
