# Encryption Protocols Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the encryption protocols utilized in our system, including the algorithms used for encryption and decryption, as well as key management practices.

## Encryption Algorithms
We employ the following encryption algorithms:

### 1. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)
- **Type**: Asymmetric encryption
- **Key Size**: 2048 bits
- **Use Case**: Securely encrypting small amounts of data, such as symmetric keys or sensitive information.
- **Padding Scheme**: OAEP (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding) with SHA-256 for enhanced security.

### 2. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- **Type**: Symmetric encryption
- **Key Size**: 256 bits
- **Use Case**: Encrypting large amounts of data efficiently.
- **Mode of Operation**: CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) with a secure IV (Initialization Vector).

## Key Management Practices
- **Key Generation**: Keys are generated using secure algorithms and stored in a secure directory (`encryption_keys/`).
- **Key Storage**: Private keys are stored in a PEM file format and protected from unauthorized access. Public keys are shared with authorized parties for encryption purposes.
- **Key Rotation**: Regular key rotation practices are implemented to enhance security. Keys should be rotated at least annually or upon suspicion of compromise.
- **Key Destruction**: When keys are no longer needed, they should be securely destroyed to prevent unauthorized access.

## Security Considerations
- Ensure that private keys are never exposed or transmitted over insecure channels.
- Use strong passwords for any encrypted key storage.
- Regularly audit key management practices to ensure compliance with security policies.

## Conclusion
By adhering to these encryption protocols and key management practices, we aim to protect sensitive data and maintain the integrity and confidentiality of our systems.
